		<description>The pelt of a chaomorph. Depending on the sourced morph, it can be scaled, furred, spiny, rough, smooth or anything in between (with plenty of overlap). It is a versatile material because of this, however, due to the many different materials composing it, it does not have very high durability.</description>
