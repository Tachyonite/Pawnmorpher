    <Pawnmorph.Hediffs.MutationDef>
        this is a subclass of HediffDef so all hediff stuff can go here 



        the hediff class must be Hediff_AddedMutation or a subclass 
        <hediffClass>Hediff_AddedMutation</hediffClass>  

        this is houw you add custom graphics to this mutation        <graphics>
            each entry should be an anchorID and texture path as shown below 
            the given texture will render on the pawn at  the corresponding 'anchor' (see Human Graphics Patch) when a pawn has that mutation on that part
            see Gazelle_Parts.xml for a concrete example 
            <AnchorID>TexturePath/ToMutation</AnchorID>
        </graphics>

        <stages>
            this is a special hediff stage used specifically to give more functionality to mutations 
            <li Class="Pawnmorph.Hediffs.MutationStage">
                <description>text here will override the hediff's normal description</description>
                <labelOverride>text here will override the hediff's normal label</labelOverride>
                
                mutations can also have graphics visible only at certain stages, if present these graphics will be shown 
                if the mutation is at this stage or higher and there is no other graphics on a higher stage                <graphics>
                    each entry should be an anchorID and texture path as shown below 
                    the given texture will render on the pawn at  the corresponding 'anchor' (see Human Graphics Patch) when a pawn has that mutation on that part
                    <AnchorID>TexturePath/ToMutation</AnchorID>
                </graphics>

                this element is a list of aspect givers that will trigger only once when the pawn enters this stage
                see GivingAspects Examples for more information on AspectGivers

                <mutation>MutationDef</mutation>
                if true, this mutation will block the addition of the above mutation on any part of the pawn 
                not just on the part this mutation is currently on

        <blocksAllOnSamePart></blocksAllOnSamePart>

        this is a list of all parts the mutation can be applied to 
        this must be set and have at least 1 entry 
        <parts>

        </parts>

        this is a list of all categories this mutation belongs to 
        <categories>

        optional field. If set the mutation will add the thought def when added 
        
        <mutationMemory>SomeMemoryDef</mutationMemory>
        note, by default these respect the 'maxMutationThoughts' in the mod settings 
        if you want a particular thought to always be added and stay added regardless of other mutation thoughts present 
        on a pawn set the below field to true 
        <memoryIgnoresLimit>true</memoryIgnoresLimit>
