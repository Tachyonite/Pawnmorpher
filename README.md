# Pawnmorpher
## A mod all about mutation for Rimworld 1.4!

![Preview](https://github.com/TACHYON-Micah/Pawnmorpher/blob/master/About/Preview.png) 

The discovery of mutagen is sure to change your world, and your pawns. Use it to improve or exploit, but be careful, as it can be somewhat unpredictable.

# Features

- Buy, find or create a range of mutagens to augment your pawns or prisoners, with an expanding array of animal-themed mutations! There is often a high chance that the affected pawn will fully transform into an animal, so mind that.
- Mutations begin weak but improve over time as they develop and the pawn adapts to them.
- Stabilise or revert unwanted mutations to prevent them progressing any further.
- Fabricate guns and shells to mutate raiders at a distance, but be warned that they may not always take it so well.
- New events: The mutagenic ship chunk, mutonite meteor and diseases such as cowflu might test your colonist's resolve! (Toggleable in mod settings)
- Chimera: Unrestrained use of mutagens might result in strange chimeric creatures.
