		<baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] spent [PAWN_possessive] life associated with an occult group who worshiped a goat-like deity. As soon as the cult got their hands on morph technology they immediately injected themselves in a pact-like mass transformation to bring themselves closer to their god. [PAWN_nameDef] was the only one left with measurable sapience and has been wandering since.</baseDescription>
